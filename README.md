# Historical Nexus Website Documentation

The [Historical Nexus](https://historicalnexus.com/) website is an academic platform dedicated to the study of historical events and their impact on societies and politics. 



 These regions include:

 - **Russia-Ukraine**: The project delves into the complexities of the territorial disputes between these nations, particularly focusing on Russia's annexation of Crimea and the subsequent armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. It also examines the role of international entities in this conflict, including their economic sanctions against Russia and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.​ 
  
- **Korea**: The project explores the division of the Korean peninsula after World War II and the ensuing ideological differences that eventually led to the Korean War. It scrutinizes the considerable international military intervention during the war, including support from the US and other UN countries to South Korea and back from China and the USSR to North Korea. 

- **Chile**: The project investigates Chile's political history, focusing on the rule of General Augusto Pinochet and the widespread human rights violations that occurred during his reign. It also discusses the support extended by the United States and its allies to Pinochet, primarily due to their anti-communist stance during the Cold War and the eventual transition to democracy in Chile after Pinochet's rule. 

- **Western Sahara**: The project studies the conflict in Western Sahara, a disputed territory claimed by Morocco and the Polisario Front-backed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The project highlights the impact of this conflict on civilian populations, leading to displacement and economic hardship, as well as the complexities and limitations of international law in enforcing resolutions and preventing violations​.
