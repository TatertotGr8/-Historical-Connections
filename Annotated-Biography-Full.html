            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison, S. Zamakda is the author of the article "The Impact of the Green March on Modern Moroccan Society," published in the SSRN Electronic Journal in 2021. The article focuses on the impact of the Green March on Moroccan society and critically analyzes the event's historical and cultural significance. The Green March was a peaceful protest organized by Morocco in 1975 to claim the sovereignty of the Western Sahara, which Spain then controlled. The event was significant not only because it resulted in Morocco's eventual control of Western Sahara but also because it profoundly impacted Moroccan society. The article highlights this impact by examining the political, social, and cultural changes after the event. The author, Allison, is an expert in African studies and has published several articles on Moroccan history and culture. The article draws on a wide range of primary and secondary sources, including government reports, news articles, and academic papers, to comprehensively analyze the event's impact. The author's analysis is well-supported, and the arguments are logical and convincing. This article is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history and culture of Morocco, as well as for those interested in the impact of political events on society. It critically analyzes the Green March, shedding light on its impact on modern Moroccan society and its ongoing significance in contemporary politics. The article is well-written, well-researched, and presents a balanced view of the events, making it a valuable contribution to African studies.<br>

            <br>“A Short History of the Korean War.” Imperial War Museums,&nbsp;https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/a-short-history-of-the-korean-war#:~:text=The%20Korean%20War%20started%20on,divided%20along%20the%2038th%20parallel.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Imperial War Museums' "A Short History of the Korean War" provides a brief overview of the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953. The article introduces the geopolitical context of the time, explaining how Korea had been divided along the 38th parallel following World War II, with the Soviet Union occupying the North and the United States occupying the South. The article then delves into the events that led to the outbreak of war, including the North Korean invasion of the South in June 1950. It describes how the United States and its allies, under the auspices of the United Nations, intervened to support the South and how the Chinese later entered the conflict on the side of the North. The author provides a clear and concise narrative of the war's major events, including the Battle of Inchon, the Chinese counteroffensive, and the armistice negotiations that ultimately ended the conflict. The strength of this source is its accessibility. The article is straightforward, making it an excellent introduction for those unfamiliar with the Korean War.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, "Western Sahara: Human Rights, Self-Determination, and the UN Mission," was published in 1995. HRW is a leading non-governmental organization dedicated to the protection and promotion of human rights around the world. This report analyzes the human rights situation in Western Sahara, a disputed territory in North Africa. The report is divided into five sections, including an introduction, historical background, human rights violations, obstacles to self-determination, and the role of the United Nations (UN) mission in the region. The introduction sets the context of the conflict and the relevance of the human rights situation in Western Sahara. The historical background provides a comprehensive overview of the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front and the involvement of other countries and international organizations in the conflict. The report highlights a range of human rights violations committed by Moroccan security forces in Western Sahara, including arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings. It also describes restrictions on freedom of expression, association, assembly, and discrimination against the Sahrawi population. The report argues that these violations undermine the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination. The report concludes by highlighting the role of the UN mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and the obstacles to its effectiveness. It notes that the mission's mandate is limited and lacks the power to monitor human rights violations or ensure that the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination is respected. The report calls for expanding MINURSO's mandate to address these issues and more significant pressure on Morocco to improve its human rights record in Western Sahara. The HRW report thoroughly analyzes the human rights situation in Western Sahara and the obstacles to self-determination. Its recommendations for expanding the UN mission's mandate and addressing human rights violations remain relevant today. The report is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the conflict in Western Sahara and the broader issues of human rights and self-determination.</span>

            <br>Rozas-Krause, Valentina. "Interrupted Stadium: Broken Promises of Modernity in the National Stadium of Chile." International Journal of Iberian Studies, vol. 8, no. 1-2, 2021, pp. 60-75, doi: 10.1386/ijis_0037_1.&nbsp;<br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rozas-Krause's article explores the history and cultural significance of the National Stadium of Chile, built-in 1938 as a symbol of modernity and progress. The article focuses on how the stadium, intended to embody the ideals of a modern and democratic society, became a site of political repression and violence during the Pinochet regime in the 1970s. The author argues that the stadium's original purpose as a symbol of modernity was subverted by the violent actions within its walls during the dictatorship, including the imprisonment, torture, and execution of political dissidents. The article also examines how the stadium was repurposed in the post-dictatorship period as a site of memory and commemoration for the regime's victims. Through a detailed analysis of archival materials, contemporary media coverage, and personal narratives, Rozas-Krause provides a compelling account of how the National Stadium of Chile serves as a site of contested memory, representing both the broken promises of modernity and the resilience of those who suffered under the dictatorship. The article offers valuable insights into how cultural symbols can be reinterpreted and contested over time and sheds light on the ongoing struggle to come to terms with Chile's traumatic past.</span>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The article aims to comprehensively analyze Japanese colonial ideology in Korea from 1905-1945. Wei explores how Japan justified its colonial rule in Korea and how its ideology evolved. The author uses a range of primary and secondary sources, including Japanese government documents, propaganda materials, and scholarly works, to provide a detailed and nuanced analysis of the subject matter. Wei's article "Japanese Colonial Ideology in Korea (1905-1945)" was published in The Yale Review of International Studies in October 2019. The author, Yi Wei, graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in Political Science and Asian Studies. Wei argues that Japanese colonial ideology in Korea was based on the notion of racial superiority, which held that the Japanese people were superior to the Korean people. This ideology was used to justify the colonization of Korea and the subjugation of its people. However, Wei notes that the Japanese colonial ideology evolved and became more complex, incorporating ideas of modernization, nationalism, and cultural assimilation. Wei's article provides a valuable contribution to understanding Japanese colonial ideology in Korea. The author's use of primary and secondary sources and their analysis of the subject matter provides readers with a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between Japan and Korea during Japanese colonization.
