All four projects involve the examination of historical events and their impact on the societies and politics of their respective regions. The projects share a common theme of conflict and the effects of foreign interference. The regions in question are Russia and Ukraine, Korean society, Chile's political situation, and th​e Western Sahara conflict. The projects on Russia-Ukraine and Western Sahara both involve the issue of territorial disputes and the involvement of outside powers, while the projects on Korea and Chile both focus on the impact of foreign occupation on their respective countries. The project's goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the origins and implications of significant events, including the Mongolian invasion, the Coup led by General Augusto Pinochet, and the Green March. Various primary and secondary sources were utilized, such as historical records, archives, personal accounts, books, academic articles, news reports, and documentaries. All four projects aim to provide a deeper understanding of the origins of present problems and conflicts in their regions and to contribute to efforts towards reconciliation and peace.&nbsp;<b>

                        <td class="u-border-2 u-border-black u-grey-15 u-table-cell u-table-cell-6"> Both conflicts demonstrate the direct impact on civilian populations, leading to displacement and economic hardship, while also highlighting the complexities and limitations of international law in enforcing resolutions and preventing violations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict originates from the historical, cultural, and political ties between the two nations, notably aggravated by Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The Western Sahara conflict arises from decolonization, with Morocco and the Polisario Front-backed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic vying for sovereignty.<br>
                          <br>The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and its subsequent support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine led to a protracted conflict that continues to this day. As a result, countless civilians have been displaced from their homes, forced to seek refuge in safer regions or even neighboring countries. Displacement often disrupts families, separates loved ones, and exposes individuals to harsh living conditions and inadequate access to necessities such as food, water, and healthcare. Moreover, the conflict has brought economic hardship to both Ukraine and Russia, affecting the livelihoods of civilians and exacerbating poverty rates.<br>
                          <br>Similarly, the Western Sahara conflict, stemming from the process of decolonization, has had a direct impact on civilian populations in the region. Morocco and the Polisario Front-backed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic have long fought for sovereignty over the Western Sahara territory. As the conflict persists, the civilian population of Western Sahara has experienced displacement, often forced to flee their homes due to violence and insecurity. These displacements disrupt communities, strain social structures, and leave individuals vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Moreover, the ongoing conflict hampers economic development in the region, impeding opportunities for livelihood and growth for the civilian population.<br>
                          <br>Major global powers, like the United States, play significant roles in these disputes, reflecting their geopolitical interests and strategic alignments. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US's strategic alignment with Ukraine and against Russian aggression fits within its broader commitment to NATO and its alliances in Europe. This alignment is driven by the specific issues in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the larger US objective of maintaining a rules-based international order. The US has consistently supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, viewing Russia's actions as challenging the established international order. In the Western Sahara conflict, the US's recent decision to recognize Moroccan sovereignty is aligned with its strategic objective of normalizing relations between Israel and Arab states, a key policy aim for the US in the Middle East. However, this shift in policy has been controversial and could be subject to change under different administrations. The US's stance has shifted over time. Traditionally, the US has supported UN-led efforts for a political solution without taking a definitive stance on the issue of sovereignty.&nbsp;<br>

The Korean War originated from the ideological divide between North and South Korea. North Korea sought to unify the peninsula under communism. In contrast, the Chilean coup responded to a combination of domestic factors and external influences. Chile faced economic instability and political polarization, contributing to a discontent climate. The United States, concerned about the spread of socialism, covertly supported and influenced the coup. <br>
                          <br>The actors involved in these events also contrast. In the Korean War, North Korea received support from China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, South Korea garnered backing from a United Nations coalition led by the United States. The conflict drew in troops from various UN member states, making it an international affair. On the other hand, the Chilean coup centered around General Pinochet and elements within the Chilean military who orchestrated the overthrow of President Allende's government.

The conflict solidified the Cold War division between communist and non-communist states. It heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The war also led to significant loss of life and infrastructure damage in North and South Korea. In contrast, the Chilean coup brought a military dictatorship under General Pinochet until 1990. Pinochet's regime implemented repressive policies, including human rights abuses, censorship, and suppression of political dissent. The coup marked a decline in democratic institutions and triggered lasting social and political divisions within Chilean society. Chilean citizens experienced widespread repression and suffered from the consequences of Pinochet's authoritarian rule.

                        <td class="u-border-2 u-border-black u-grey-15 u-table-cell u-table-cell-12">The Korean conflict garnered significant attention during the Cold War era. The ideological rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union heightened the stakes, with both superpowers supporting their respective Korean allies. China also played a role in supporting North Korea. The conflict could escalate into a more significant confrontation, and multinational forces, primarily under the umbrella of the United Nations Command, were deployed to support South Korea and maintain stability in the region. The Western Sahara conflict received relatively less international attention. While various countries expressed their positions on the issue, the conflict did not attract the same global focus as the Korean conflict. The United Nations played a more prominent role in attempting to resolve the conflict through diplomacy and peacekeeping. MINURSO was established to monitor the ceasefire and create conditions for a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. <br>
                          <br>The Korean War and the Western Sahara Conflict share the unsettling legacy of prolonged instability and persistent tension. In the aftermath of the Korean War, an armistice was signed, creating a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that punctuated the Korean peninsula. However, this peace is fragile and tenuous. North and South Korea are still technically at war, a shadow that looms even as we pass the threshold into the 2020s. The Western Sahara Conflict, which reached a stalemate, saw the ushering in of a United Nations-supervised ceasefire in 1991. While curtailing active hostilities, this development gave birth to its complex challenges. A protracted refugee situation emerged, and sovereignty disputes persisted, adding complexity to an already tangled issue. Both these situations stand testament to the lasting ripples of conflict, echoing across decades, shaping nations and impacting lives well beyond the cessation of direct combat.

The coup marked a decline in democratic institutions and triggered lasting social and political divisions within Chilean society. Chilean citizens experienced widespread repression and suffered from the consequences of Pinochet's authoritarian rule.

                        <td class="u-border-2 u-border-black u-grey-15 u-table-cell u-table-cell-20"> Both conflicts demonstrate the direct impact on civilian populations, leading to displacement and economic hardship, while also highlighting the complexities and limitations of international law in enforcing resolutions and preventing violations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict originates from the historical, cultural, and political ties between the two nations, notably aggravated by Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The Western Sahara conflict arises from decolonization, with Morocco and the Polisario Front-backed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic vying for sovereignty.<br>
                          <br>The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and its subsequent support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine led to a protracted conflict that continues to this day. As a result, countless civilians have been displaced from their homes, forced to seek refuge in safer regions or even neighboring countries. Displacement often disrupts families, separates loved ones, and exposes individuals to harsh living conditions and inadequate access to necessities such as food, water, and healthcare. Moreover, the conflict has brought economic hardship to both Ukraine and Russia, affecting the livelihoods of civilians and exacerbating poverty rates.<br>
                          <br>Similarly, the Western Sahara conflict, stemming from the process of decolonization, has had a direct impact on civilian populations in the region. Morocco and the Polisario Front-backed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic have long fought for sovereignty over the Western Sahara territory. As the conflict persists, the civilian population of Western Sahara has experienced displacement, often forced to flee their homes due to violence and insecurity. These displacements disrupt communities, strain social structures, and leave individuals vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Moreover, the ongoing conflict hampers economic development in the region, impeding opportunities for livelihood and growth for the civilian population.<br>
                          <br>Major global powers, like the United States, play significant roles in these disputes, reflecting their geopolitical interests and strategic alignments. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US's strategic alignment with Ukraine and against Russian aggression fits within its broader commitment to NATO and its alliances in Europe. This alignment is driven by the specific issues in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the larger US objective of maintaining a rules-based international order. The US has consistently supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, viewing Russia's actions as challenging the established international order. In the Western Sahara conflict, the US's recent decision to recognize Moroccan sovereignty is aligned with its strategic objective of normalizing relations between Israel and Arab states, a key policy aim for the US in the Middle East. However, this shift in policy has been controversial and could be subject to change under different administrations. The US's stance has shifted over time. Traditionally, the US has supported UN-led efforts for a political solution without taking a definitive stance on the issue of sovereignty.&nbsp;

                          <br>The Korean War and the Western Sahara Conflict share the unsettling legacy of prolonged instability and persistent tension. In the aftermath of the Korean War, an armistice was signed, creating a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that punctuated the Korean peninsula. However, this peace is fragile and tenuous. North and South Korea are still technically at war, a shadow that looms even as we pass the threshold into the 2020s. The Western Sahara Conflict, which reached a stalemate, saw the ushering in of a United Nations-supervised ceasefire in 1991. While curtailing active hostilities, this development gave birth to its complex challenges. A protracted refugee situation emerged, and sovereignty disputes persisted, adding complexity to an already tangled issue. Both these situations stand testament to the lasting ripples of conflict, echoing across decades, shaping nations and impacting lives well beyond the cessation of direct combat.
